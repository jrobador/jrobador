### ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I am a **Principal AI Engineer**, recognized with the **Fulbright Scholarship (Top 5% of Argentina)** and awarded at global hackathons like **META**. 

My focus is on building robust, scalable AI solutions from the ground up. I bridge the gap between fundamental research in neural models (like my work at **INRIA**) and the practical engineering required to ship high-impact products.
