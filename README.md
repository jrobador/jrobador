## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m JoaquÃ­n AndrÃ©s Robador!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building advanced machine learning models and LLM applications across various fields.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced techniques in large language models (LLMs) using LangChain, including retrieval-augmented generation, prompt engineering, and scalable deployment strategies. Iâ€™m also expanding my skills in cloud platforms and containerization tools like Docker and Kubernetes to ensure robust deployment of AI applications.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to reach out at joaquinrobador@gmail.com
- ðŸ“‚ Explore My Projects: Check out my [Data Science Projects](https://github.com/jrobador/data_science/tree/main) where I've applied machine learning to real-world scenarios such as fraud detection, credit scoring, and census income predictions. These projects leverage frameworks and libraries like Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Seaborn, XGBoost, t-SNE, PCA, and comprehensive data processing (ETL) workflows to deliver robust analytical insights. Also, you can find all theories I learned during my classes at MIT with Scikit-Learn.
